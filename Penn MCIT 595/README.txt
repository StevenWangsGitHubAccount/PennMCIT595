I hope to (1) get a better understanding of operating systems; (2) become comfortable with the command line; and (3) improve my C programming skills in this course. 
I look forward to learning a lot in this semester.

Frankly, my experiences with setting up vagrant and github could have gone more smoothly. However, I think I'm close to getting this done.
