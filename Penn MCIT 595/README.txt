I hope to (1) get a better understanding of operating systems; (2) become comfortable with the command line; and (3) improve my C programming skills in this course. 
I look forward to learning a lot in this semester.

Mostly, my experiences with setting up the Git repository and Vagrant have gone reasonably well. There have been some hiccups, but I've managed to figure out solutions.
